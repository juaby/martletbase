//! A high-performance broker that mediates inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service grid.
//! It supports dynamic service discovery, load balancing, TLS, termination, HTTP/2 and GPRC proxies, fuse-outs, health checks, fault injection, and performance measurements.
//! The Martlet is deployed in the POD of the associated service in a sidecar manner, eliminating the need to rebuild or rewrite the code
